      <h3>A Website About Our Nearest Celestial Neighbor</h3>
      <p>The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>

      <h3> The Dark Side</h3>
      <p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an influence since ancient times on language, calendars, art, and mythology. The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.</p>

      <h3>Intrigued?</h3> 
      <p>The moon has played a huge role in human existence. We sing about it, made plans by it, have words derived from its inspiration. This site is dedicated to the marvels of the moon and all that it has inspired. </p></div>
